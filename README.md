# Deep Learning Project Archive

Umbrella project housing a collection of various Deep Learning studies and POCs implemented part as study material, part as a project portfolio. Projects are managed as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in order to maintain ~~my own sanity~~ better synchronization across sub-repos.

If for any reason getting access to the code in this project is relevant to you, make sure to pass `--recurse-submodules` when cloning it. The following index shadows the repo directory structure.
